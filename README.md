<h1>Project Name : Eway | Mobile Market</h1>

<p>This web project is designed to help me level up my game in web development. Throughout the development process, I covered various technologies, tools, and skills. Here are some of the key highlights:</p>

<ul>
<li>Redux for State Management: I implemented Redux to manage the state of my web application, enabling efficient data flow and centralized state management.</li>

<li>Component-Based Architecture: I focused on reusability by breaking down  code into small, reusable components. This approach promotes modularity and makes code easier to maintain and understand.</li>

<li>Effective Use of React Hooks: I utilized React hooks such as useState, useEffect, and useRef to handle different aspects of application's state and lifecycle management. This allows for efficient and optimized coding practices.</li>

<li>Material UI CSS Framework: I leveraged the Material UI CSS framework to create a visually appealing and consistent user interface. This framework offers pre-built components and styling options, reducing the need for custom CSS coding.</li>

<li>Responsive UI Design: I ensured that web application's user interface is responsive and adapts seamlessly to various screen resolutions and device types. This enhances the user experience and accessibility across different devices.</li>


<li>Image Optimization with Cloudinary: I utilized Cloudinary, a cloud-based media management platform, to store and serve  website's images. By dynamically loading images based on user requements, I optimized the loading time and bandwidth usage.</li>


<li>Deployment and Hosting: I deployed the backend of  application using Vercel, a cloud platform, while the frontend is hosted on Netlify, a popular hosting service. This ensures that  web project is accessible to users online.</li>

</ul>
